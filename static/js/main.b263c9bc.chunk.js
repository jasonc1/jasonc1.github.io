So for icons, we would determine (via audits) the list of icons that were commonly used: checkmark, up, down, and so on. For special icons like a loan document in which the enterprise app would be the only user of such icon, the enterprise product team would thus bring in their own icon. How would they do that?

The problem wasn\u2019t so much the auditing, but was to try and figure out if we should support 2 or 3 variants and how we would handle that for theming.
