OTM is a very intricate experience\n          since there is a huge amount of behind the scenes processes that need\n          to happen sequentially for the experience to work. The design team had\n          to figure out the whole flow (at a high level) from:\n        </div>,\n        <List\n          ordered\n          size=\"body-1\"\n          listItems={[\n            'Logging into their financial institution',\n            'Providing consent for OTM',\n            'Surfacing a potentially long loading state while OTM fetches and processes data',\n            \"Showcasing and educating a user's buying power\",\n            'Produce a preapproval letter',\n            'Provide methods for a user to edit or add information to increase their buying power or modify the preapproval letter',\n          ]}\n        ></List>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={OTMEmblem}\n          iphone\n          caption=\"OTM is a whitelabel solution\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          One of the biggest features of OTM was how everything was done behind\n          the scenes, but that meant that there would be possibly a gap of time\n          where the user had to wait for OTM to process data and crunch numbers.\n          Thus, we had to design a loading experience that ranged from 15 to 30\n          seconds that was meaningful to the user - not just some spinner going\n          infinitely. Using Lottie, we were able to successfully deliver an\n          experience to Engineering as well as use it in our prototype in the\n          early stages of design and ideation.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption src={OTMLoading} caption=\"Loading states for OTM\" />,\n        <div>\n          On top of having to produce a brand new experience, we needed to be\n          able to verify the experience through user testing, and we found that\n          a click through mock up wasn’t enough: in order to user test the\n          experience, the information provided to a user needed to be dynamic.\n          Furthermore, we not only wanted to see if this experience was\n          feasible, but we wanted to test for user comprehension. The OTM\n          experience was going to not only provide a preapproval letter on\n          demand, but the hope was to also educate and simplify the home buying\n          process for new home buyers as well. Instances of user testing\n          include: Authentication and Prefill explorations and Buying Power\n          comprehension.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Lastly, since this was a flagship project, the Design department found\n          itself having to produce collateral/demos for sales pitches, product\n          showcases at conventions, and other marketing material. Thus, the\n          prototype was architected in a way so that the demo could be tailor\n          made to simulate a branded experience for Blend’s high profile\n          clients.

Initially, I was just\n          curious as to what FramerX was since Framer Classic (rip) was very\n          nice to use, and FramerX leveraged ReactJS. However, I found that it\n          was very hard to pass data between screens and despite being able to\n          leverage production level components, it was very cumbersome,\n          inefficient, and not dynamic.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={OTMFramerX}\n          iphone\n          caption=\"OTM in its early days, built with FramerX\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          I moved on to prototyping solely in ReactJS. This was mainly out of\n          convenience for leveraging react components and thus it was easier to\n          handle data and inputs from users. Moreover, this was also requested\n          from Engineering, since they felt that it could be an easier handoff\n          since they could reference the ReactJS code when needed. I spent about\n          3 weeks of non stop coding to produce a {ForumDemo} that could mock\n          the whole experience (with loading state and dynamic inputs).\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Later on, I was able to spend some time refactoring the prototype\n          (while also making design iterations) so that we could easily change\n          the branding color and logo of the prototype. Making the switch to\n          prototyping in ReactJS from FramerX made it immensely easy.\n          Re-branding a FramerX file would take probably hours while updating\n          the code in ReactJS (barring the time it took to do the refactoring\n          work) would take roughly 15 minutes. The upfront cost proved to save\n          me time since I ended up making 5+ sales demos over the two months\n          after.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={OTMProtopie}\n          white\n          caption=\"Authentication and Prefill prototypes for user testing\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          We then moved on to a second iteration of the OTM experience, and the\n          design team was looking into ways improve and test the log in and\n          prefill experiences for OTM. I found this a good time to try out a new\n          tool since the scope of the user testing was much much smaller\n          (compared to a whole end to end experience). Thus, I tried out\n          ProtoPie, and it was a very pleasant and fast way to make a no-code\n          hi-fi prototype. ProtoPie saved me time in creating multiple versions\n          of a log in experience (there were 4) and prefill experience (there\n          were 3). I made a total of 7 prototypes within the span of a week\n          without having to code. It did take some time since there’s a whole\n          lot of clicking, but leveraging ProtoPie for this project helped\n          inspire designers to try out the tool to create their own prototypes.\n          This served as a pilot so that we could empower product designers to\n          prototype things on their own and bring me in if they\n        </div>,\n      ],\n    },\n  ];\n  return (\n    <Projects\n      title=\"One-Tap Mobile\"\n      date=\"Mar 2019 - Sept 2019\"\n      summary={summaryText}\n      content={OTMContent}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default OTM;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/accordion_ids.e6b2694d.gif\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/accordion_tron.c79fbecf.gif\";","import React from 'react';\nimport Projects from '../../components/templates/prose/prose.component';\nimport accordion_ids from '../../assets/images/projects/intuit/accordion_ids.gif';\nimport accordion_tron from '../../assets/images/projects/intuit/accordion_tron.gif';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Text } from '../../components/text/text.component';\nimport { List } from '../../components/list/list.component';\nimport { ImageWithCaption } from '../../components/ImageWithCaption/ImageWithCaption.component';\n\nexport const IDSAccordion = () => {\n  const Intuit = (\n    <Link className=\"action-link\" to=\"/DocUploader\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"Intuit\" />\n    </Link>\n  );\n  const summaryText = (\n    <div>\n      <ImageWithCaption\n        src={accordion_tron}\n        caption=\"The Intuit Design Systems Accordion seen in Payments Onboarding with Chase in production\"\n      />\n      During my time as a software engineer at {Intuit}, I came across an\n      opportunity to contribute to an upcoming design system: Intuit Design\n      System [IDS].

This accordion was made\n          so that custom header and body content could be used so that consumers\n          of this component had full control as to what they want to display to\n          the user. This is powerful so that the accordion could be dynamic:\n          different states of the accordion could show different content.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n        </div>,\n        <div>Key Features:</div>,\n        <List\n          size=\"body-1\"\n          listItems={[\n            'Collaboration with motion designers to be consistent with Intuit’s new motion design guidelines',\n            'Customizable to different themes to match Intuit’s respective products',\n            'Working towards graduation for officially being a part of Intuit Design Systems',\n            'Upgraded project to React 16',\n            'Collaboration with Accessibility team to meet Intuit’s standards',\n            'Provide help and information externally to other teams for consumption',\n          ]}\n        ></List>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={accordion_ids}\n          caption=\"The Accordion in the Intuit Design Systems gallery\"\n        />,\n\n        <div>\n          At the end of the contribution, I was able to make something that\n          could be used throughout Intuit, as I felt that it would be ultimately\n          inefficient for another team to develop the same thing.

However, the main\n          problem was that StratRoulette was in ALPHA stages, and if we wanted\n          to develop more features, we would need a foundation for design. With\n          a foundation of layout and common ui components, Justin could spend\n          more time on developing features. StratRoulette also lacked in things\n          like feature discovery and promoting user engagement.

Ultimately, we wanted to develop a design language so that\n          we could scale and build something that looked more modern.

A landing page was also needed since we want to showcase what\n          StratRoulette is used for and what it can do.

My first\n          order of business was mainly just to create a small foundation of UI\n          components: font, colors, input, grid, and more. Once that foundation\n          was layed out, StratRoulette had some sort of identity, thus we could\n          move on with creating layouts and certain user flows like landing\n          page, submitting a start, etc.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          I really wanted to make sure the whole website was made so that it\n          could be catered towards different types of games, as we were thinking\n          of expanding from CS:GO. I ultimately was just tired of seeing really\n          bright or neon and crazy looking text on websites to fit the brand of\n          the game, and since SR is not really tied to a game, I figured I could\n          just start from scratch and keep it minimal. I first just started out\n          by picking some colors, really just anything I felt, and at that time\n          I felt like electric blue and a dark black/grey would be pretty\n          fitting as accent colors. All the icons made in SR were also created\n          by me with a little bit of illustrator magic.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={SRLegacy_spec}\n          caption=\"StratRoulette initial component spec sheet\"\n        />,\n        <Text\n          size=\"subheader-1\"\n          text=\"Logo designs\"\n          marginTop={16}\n          marginBottom={16}\n        />,\n        <div>\n          The first order of business for StratRoulette was for me to create a\n          logo. The biggest motivation for me was to not make it look to\n          “gamer,” and also not too boring. What I shortly realized was that\n          making some sort of logo or monogram with the letters “S” and “R” were\n          quit tricky.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          The first iterations were based on a hexagonal shape, similar to a\n          revolver barrel. I wanted to really emphasize the roulette part, and I\n          thought it would be interesting with the idea “russian roulette.”\n          However, it was hard for me to execute and figure out where the S\n          would ultimately be.\n        </div>,\n        <img\n          className=\"SR-logo\"\n          src={SRLegacy_logo_2}\n          alt={'sr logo attempt 1'}\n        />,\n        <div>\n          Then, I tried more of a symmetric approach, as I tried to make the S\n          and the R shapes look more similar, but it just seemed to take too\n          much space\n        </div>,\n        <img\n          className=\"SR-logo\"\n          src={SRLegacy_logo_4}\n          alt={'sr logo attepmt 2'}\n        />,\n        <div>\n          Next was some sort of lightning bolt to convey the fast paced nature\n          of SR, and the R was placed as more of an exponent and not the main\n          focus.\n        </div>,\n        <img\n          className=\"SR-logo\"\n          src={SRLegacy_logo_6}\n          alt={'sr logo attempt 3'}\n        />,\n        <div>\n          However, the last iteration was something completely unorthodox. I was\n          really inspired by something like Parley’s icons with some sort of\n          circle border, and I just toyed around with switching the emphasis of\n          the letters. Ultimately, I came to this by just trying it out, but I\n          seemed to like it more: the letter “R” seemed to fit better with a\n          Circle, as it wasn’t clashing with either sharp edges or curved edges\n          of the bends. This logo is used for the main page, as well as the\n          favicon. Note that the favicon does not have the “StratRoulette” text\n          in the circle, as it is too small to be read or seen.\n        </div>,\n        <img\n          className=\"SR-logo\"\n          src={SRLegacy_logo_final}\n          alt={'sr logo final'}\n        />,\n\n        <Text\n          size=\"subheader-1\"\n          text=\"Product designs\"\n          marginTop={16}\n          marginBottom={16}\n        />,\n        <div>\n          The most important part was to showcase the Strat card because it was\n          the one thing that users directly interacted with. We wanted to show\n          what new things we added: color coding towards games, a save and share\n          button, tags, etc, and furthermore this would be a component that\n          shows up everywhere. We wanted to provide a way for people to\n          contribute strats, search/filter for strats, roll strats (when they\n          play the game), and comment on strats.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={SRLegacy_STRAT_card}\n          caption=\"The strat card showcasing tags, votes, share button, and improved information hierarchy.\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          A big problem with StratRoulette's original strat card was that there\n          was no separation of information: there was a string of text for a\n          strat and the name of the user who submitted it. Furthermore, the\n          information blended into the webpage, there was no way for a user to\n          really understand that a strat was present upon the first roll or page\n          load. Thus, the idea of a strat card came into play: we wanted to\n          effectively provide information to the user. Since strats are viewed\n          quickly during games, it is important to have proper information\n          hierarchy: valuable time is lost to the user if they have to look\n          carefully, and sometimes users do not have the patience to look around\n          for information.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={SRLegacy_Alpha}\n          caption=\"StratRoulette's early version of a start: you could not distinguish what information was important or not.\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          The Home page is quite similar to something you would typically see in\n          most social media feeds. The idea was that we wanted to show the\n          activity feeds of people that a user follow and show what Strats are\n          being favorited or created.

On top of that, we had what turned out to be\n          roughly 100 projects (750+ files sketch files) in Abstract. The team\n          eventually abandoned the plan to sunset Abstract because of the sheer\n          amount of manual labor it would entail: downloading each branch from\n          each project and then moving the files to Box.\n        </div>,\n      ],\n    },\n    {\n      section: 'Solution & Deliverables',\n      content: [\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={AbstractMigrateDefine}\n          caption=\"Defining what success looks like for the roll out plan.\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          In March 2020, the PD team decided to revisit sunsetting Abstract as\n          the team found that most designers are now designing in Figma and\n          spending roughly 10% of their time in Sketch. For the most part, most\n          of the tasks being done in Sketch were simply referencing old files\n          less so designing.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Thus, the design technology team set out to create a quarter long plan\n          to roll out sunsetting Abstract. The first task at hand was to create\n          a plan that would factor in the amount of time it require to have\n          designers manually migrate their files each at a bi-weekly or monthly\n          cadence. However, we decided to revisit the Abstract API to see if\n          they made any feature updates. Much to our surprise, they added\n          support to download files programmatically. we devised a plan that\n          determined when product designers should stop using Abstract, batch\n          download files, labelling, and thus fully sunsetting Abstract and\n          ending the subscription.

I primarily took\n          this as an opportunity to support the Product Design team beyond\n          design systems. I’ve previously made the {AbstractMigrate} tool to\n          help with the migration off of Sketch + Abstract and on to Figma. My\n          next personal goal was to learn how to make a Figma Plugin, and upon\n          learning of a few of the issues that Product Designer’s faced, I chose\n          to make Haven for the team, and use it as a learning experience for my\n          own growth as well.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Haven makes it easy for designers to add one of two overlays:\n          “EXPLORATION” or “ARCHIVE”. The overlays added will resize based on\n          the selected frames, and the text size as well as the text itself can\n          be modified. Additionally, designers can also add ‘tags’ above each\n          frame to label frames as “Needs Review,” “Prod Ready,” or a custom\n          label. Designers just have to select the frames they’d like to label,\n          run the plugin, and configure what the label or overlay will say.\n        </div>,\n      ],\n    },\n    {\n      section: 'Process',\n      content: [\n        <div>\n          One of my goals for 2020 was to help the Product Design team more with\n          tooling and applications of code. Thus, one application of code was to\n          create a Figma Plugin since I spent a huge amount of time in Figma\n          advocating for design systems, new features, cleaning up design debt,\n          and more. However, I did not have a tangible use for a Figma Plugin,\n          and I wanted it to be worthwhile. After a few chats with the team as\n          well as a survey, I thus landed on a problem to try to solve for, and\n          thus embarked on a journey to create Haven.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          At first, Haven’s first feature was simply just adding an overlay with\n          the word “EXPLORATION” in Figma. Since this was the first time I was\n          making a plugin, I spent a few days exploring just how things worked.\n          Figma has some great documentation as to how to get everything set up,\n          but the project was just in plain html, css, and js.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Once I figured out how to programmatically ‘draw’ a frame with text\n          and color, my goal was to then use webpack and react to speed up my\n          development workflow. I actually found that using React made the\n          plugin run slower so I removed that. However, webpack was used so that\n          I didn’t have to manually refresh the application. I felt that such a\n          simple app should be fast to render and did not warrant the use of\n          React.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          A few other features were added to add more customizability for the\n          plugin. An additional overlay screen was made to call out ‘Archive’\n          screens to differentiate explorations vs legacy screens. On top of\n          that, I just played around with the idea to create two tags to aid\n          with our review process: “NEEDS REVIEW” and “PROD READY.” These tags\n          were to created to help with the handoff process and to further\n          compliment the “EXPLORATIONS” and “ARCHIVE” overlays. These were made\n          as tags since tags are less invasive and do not obscure the content of\n          the frame.\n        </div>,\n      ],\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <Projects\n      title=\"Haven\"\n      date=\"June 2020\"\n      summary={summaryText}\n      content={HavenContent}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Haven;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/figma_autolayout_2020.ef00ad79.pdf\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/figma_variants.e54306fb.pdf\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Design_systems_process.7d872d09.pdf\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/BDS.14b3e618.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/consumer_storybook.54dfc46c.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/design_systems_process.47c7be1d.png\";","import React from 'react';\nimport Projects from '../../components/templates/prose/prose.component';\nimport { Text } from '../../components/text/text.component';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { ImageWithCaption } from '../../components/ImageWithCaption/ImageWithCaption.component';\nimport FigmaAutolayoutPDF from '../../assets/misc/figma_autolayout_2020.pdf';\nimport FigmaVariantsPDF from '../../assets/misc/figma_variants.pdf';\nimport DesignSystemProcessPDF from '../../assets/misc/Design_systems_process.pdf';\nimport BDS from '../../assets/images/projects/misc/BDS.png';\nimport consumer_storybook from '../../assets/images/projects/misc/consumer_storybook.png';\nimport design_systems_process from '../../assets/images/projects/misc/design_systems_process.png';\n\nexport const DesignSystemsAtBlend = () => {\n  const FigmaAutolayout = (\n    <a\n      className=\"action-link\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noreferrer\"\n      href={FigmaAutolayoutPDF}\n    >\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"Figma's 2020 Autolayout features\" />\n    </a>\n  );\n  const FigmaVariants = (\n    <a\n      className=\"action-link\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noreferrer\"\n      href={FigmaVariantsPDF}\n    >\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"Figma Variants\" />\n    </a>\n  );\n  const dsystemProcess = (\n    <a\n      className=\"action-link\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noreferrer\"\n      href={DesignSystemProcessPDF}\n    >\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"proposed a process/pipeline\" />\n    </a>\n  );\n  const prototypingAtBlend = (\n    <Link className=\"action-link\" to=\"/PrototypingAtBlend\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"a year of prototyping at Blend\" />\n    </Link>\n  );\n  const IDSAccordion = (\n    <Link className=\"action-link\" to=\"/IDSAccordion\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"accordion\" />\n    </Link>\n  );\n  const OTM = (\n    <Link className=\"action-link\" to=\"/OTM\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"One-Tap Mobile (aka OTM)\" />\n    </Link>\n  );\n  const Alchemy = (\n    <Link className=\"action-link\" to=\"/Alchemy\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"Alchemy Design System\" />\n    </Link>\n  );\n  const summaryText = (\n    <div>\n      As of writing this post, I currently work on Blend’s design system,\n      Alchemy, as one of the founding members of the design system.

I found\n          that bigger companies have the resourcing to power a whole team that\n          owns a design system with tens of engineers and designers.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          As both a consumer and contributor of the design system, I got to\n          experience both ends of the system. Furthermore, I discovered what\n          requirements are needed to build a component from not only the code\n          side but also from the design side. I was exposed to taking a\n          component and meeting accessibility requirements like screen reader\n          support, keyboard shortcuts, and more. I also got an understanding of\n          the process of taking a component from our experimental library and\n          graduating it be published as an official component. Lastly, as a\n          developer, I got the pleasure of testing, creating, and educating\n          other engineers on the component for consumption in other\n          applications. Overall, looking back, I’m quite grateful to be able to\n          experience that since I can apply my own personal experiences to help\n          bring Alchemy to life at Blend. This all happened because I just\n          wanted to prototype a component interaction at Intuit, and it thus led\n          me down a deep yet rewarding rabbithole.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Continuing my path forward with a passion for prototyping, I joined\n          Blend and embarked on a journey to bring prototyping onto Blend’s\n          radar. I prototyped {OTM} and thus discovered that Blend really could\n          use some work on the design systems front. By creating high fidelity\n          prototypes via ReactJS, I found the need for a design system: being\n          able to use a component library really saves me time from recreating\n          already existing components.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={consumer_storybook}\n          caption=\"Blend's storybook for consumer-components in 2020\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          However, I soon found that there was much more required for a\n          component library: we lacked consistency between design and\n          engineering. Colors weren’t the names or even values, we still had the\n          majority of our “reusable” components in our monolith, and, worst off\n          yet, we lacked a source of truth. While I had to build my prototypes,\n          I started finding ways to contribute to help move the needle closer to\n          1:1 parity between design and engineering. I tried to help migrate\n          components like RadioGroup out of monolith and into our shared\n          component library. I added entries for components to Storybook as well\n          as documented the available design tokens like color and typography.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Furthermore, I poked around prod and figma through countless audits to\n          highlight current design debt. At one point, I even ventured on into\n          tackling design debt in production. Notable tasks that got me really\n          in the weeds to shovel out all the design debt were: redesigning our\n          disabled state for our buttons in our enterprise app, updating\n          background colors in production, auditing icon usage, and more. For\n          one, I found that we simply don’t have the same names and values for\n          color and we were inconsistent with color usage throughout production.\n          On top of that, some of our color usage was too low in contrast, so my\n          work was to update and fix the design debt. Throughout all of those\n          tasks, I was super grateful that I spent some time actually learning\n          how to code and get the industry experience as a developer because it\n          really paid off since I could design with technical constraints in\n          mind. However, back then I did not really know what was needed for a\n          system: I kind of just did whatever I could to try and fix things. On\n          top of that, I dedicated my time towards some of the design and tech\n          debt so that it could help me do my task at hand easier: prototyping.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Roughly about a year into my time at Blend, I made a conscious effort\n          to dedicate the majority of my time to learning more about design\n          systems and doing my best to help with the effort. I really wanted to\n          get more involved on the design front, as I felt that most of my time\n          was still in the weeds of code and less so Figma or Sketch. We were\n          still in the midst of just testing out Figma before Figma really just\n          popped off and became “the future” of design tools. Funnily enough, I\n          have grown to become a huge advocate for Figma for not only my own day\n          to day but also almost acting like a mini ambassador to our design\n          team as I wanted to share the knowledge that I learned through using\n          Figma for design systems. Over time, I’ve been able to gain product\n          designers’ trust and have the opportunity to teach and inform others\n          about {FigmaAutolayout} as well as {FigmaVariants}. However, before\n          that all happened, I felt that my time spent in Figma was still quite\n          lacking since I only used it to whiteboard prototyping flows and\n          interactions.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={BDS}\n          caption=\"Borrower design system was one of the first few libraries we migrated from Sketch to Figma\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          An opportunity arose when I found that we were leaning towards\n          migrating most of our files to Figma, and two quarters later, we\n          committed as a design org that Figma would be our primary tool of\n          choice. One of the tasks at hand was to migrate our sketch library for\n          our consumer app to Figma. I volunteered myself to block out the two\n          to three weeks to migrate every. single. component. I tried to be\n          smart about the whole migration process and explored ways of importing\n          a Sketch file or simply copying over the assets, but all the line\n          heights were all messed up. Thus, we decided to redraw most of the\n          components by hand. As for illustrations, we had issues importing from\n          Sketch as well, so we had to hunt down the original assets from\n          illustrator and export them as svg and import them into Figma.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          A few of my coworkers were kind enough to help me along the way with\n          the burden (Thanks Iseri and Sara~). On top of that, Iseri taught me\n          one of the biggest takeaways of creating a system: figure out the\n          goddamn design token. It’s actually one of my fondest memories at\n          Blend since I knew nothing about Figma or managing a design library at\n          that time, and I was just so excited to learn anything I could. Thus\n          birthed Borrower Design System (in Figma), and it slowly became the\n          system that I maintained to the best of my abilities as a one man\n          team. I spent time uncovering design debt, adding documentation to\n          components, {dsystemProcess} for creating and maintaining components,\n          learned how Figma components worked, and much much more. Over the\n          course of a few quarters, I feel that my time spent migrating and\n          maintaining Borrower Design System was put to good use since it helped\n          me understand design systems on the design side.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={design_systems_process}\n          white\n          caption=\"We created a process to help design and engineering work closely together to either add or edit components.\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          From Borrower Design System, I found my passion to work on design\n          systems. Fast forward to now, I’m working on {Alchemy}. All the work I\n          did leading up to Alchemy really helped set me up to be able to work\n          on creating a design system for Blend. All the time spent auditing,\n          prototyping, and messing around in Figma really paid off since it gave\n          me a whole lot of contextual knowledge of our products, component\n          libraries, and design files. I would argue that had I not started out\n          with prototyping, I would have had much less empathy and passion\n          towards design systems. I wouldn’t have been able to experience the\n          pain, ask all the annoying questions of “Do we have ____ component?”\n          or even “Why is this color different?,” and most importantly, I\n          wouldn’t have been able to experience what life is like without a\n          proper design system. Keep in mind, prior to blend, I had the luxury\n          of consuming a fully staffed and support design system as well as the\n          opportunity to contribute to a design system.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          At Blend, I gained a whole lot of empathy and understanding the pains\n          of not having a design system. I feel like I’ve come a long way, but I\n          still have much more to learn. This whole journey has been a moment\n          where no matter the challenges I’ve faced, I still really really\n          really wanted to work on a design system. For once, I’ve felt that I\n          enjoyed every aspect of the job even at its hardest moments. For now,\n          this seems like the right path forward, and I’m looking to grow and\n          learn everything I can.\n        </div>,\n      ],\n    },\n  ];\n  return (\n    <Projects\n      title=\"Design Systems @ Blend\"\n      date=\"November 29th, 2020\"\n      summary={summaryText}\n      content={Content}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default DesignSystemsAtBlend;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/intake_form.6d57026d.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/prototypingWithFidelityInMind.3a8654c9.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Prototyping_with_functional_fidelity_in_mind.62352503.pdf\";","import React from 'react';\nimport Projects from '../../components/templates/prose/prose.component';\nimport { ImageWithCaption } from '../../components/ImageWithCaption/ImageWithCaption.component';\nimport accordion_tron from '../../assets/images/projects/intuit/accordion_tron.gif';\nimport OTMBanner from '../../assets/images/projects/OTM/OTMBanner.png';\nimport OTMProtopie from '../../assets/images/projects/OTM/OTMProtopie.png';\nimport intake_form from '../../assets/images/projects/misc/intake_form.png';\nimport prototypingWithFidelityInMind from '../../assets/images/projects/misc/prototypingWithFidelityInMind.png';\nimport prototypingWithFidelityInMindPDF from '../../assets/misc/Prototyping_with_functional_fidelity_in_mind.pdf';\nimport { Text } from '../../components/text/text.component';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nexport const PrototypingAtBlend = () => {\n  const bankerProto = (\n    <a\n      className=\"action-link\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noreferrer\"\n      href={'https://cb-banker-v1.netlify.app/'}\n    >\n      <Text\n        size=\"link-1\"\n        text=\"deposit account prototype for bankers to user test\"\n      />\n    </a>\n  );\n\n  const prototypingPDF = (\n    <a\n      className=\"action-link\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noreferrer\"\n      href={prototypingWithFidelityInMindPDF}\n    >\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"webinar\" />\n    </a>\n  );\n  const IDSAccordion = (\n    <Link className=\"action-link\" to=\"/IDSAccordion\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"accordion component for Intuit design system\" />\n    </Link>\n  );\n  const OTM = (\n    <Link className=\"action-link\" to=\"/OTM\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"One Tap Mobile (OTM)\" />\n    </Link>\n  );\n  const OTMProtopieLink = (\n    <a\n      className=\"action-link\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noreferrer\"\n      href=\"https://cloud.protopie.io/p/390140da1d\"\n    >\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"user study for OTM\" />\n    </a>\n  );\n  const WaitTaskV2 = (\n    <Link className=\"action-link\" to=\"/WaitTaskV2\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"Wait Task V2\" />\n    </Link>\n  );\n  const summaryText = (\n    <div>\n      For the last half of college, I was really interested in the prototyping\n      space while I was completing my double major in Human Computer\n      Interaction. I did enjoy creating responsive websites and creating web\n      applications, but I wanted to focus on creating high fidelity prototypes.\n      I thought the space was super new, and I heard about Framer Classic, but\n      never got a chance to try it until much much later. Throughout most of my\n      classes, I was exposed to either click through prototyping tools like\n      InVision or simply just slapping together an html, css, javascript/jquery\n      application that served as a prototype, in which I was quite accustomed\n      to. I found it hard to find a role as a ‘prototyper’ right out of college\n      since most of the roles that were available to me at the time were ‘UI/UX\n      designer’ or ‘software engineer.’ It’s only until the more recent years in\n      which I have started to see and learn more about the design technologist\n      role. I thus made a conscious decision to become a software engineer with\n      the hopes of getting professional and industry experience creating UIs\n      with ReactJS. I felt that if I had a stronger technical background, it\n      would help me become a better designer. If I know how something is made or\n      how certain technical limitations impact design, I felt that I could then\n      do something related to product design, which would then entail\n      prototyping. As you can see, there were a few steps there, and I would say\n      for about a year, I was dead set on becoming a product designer. I spent\n      days shadowing product designers inside and outside of work, seeking\n      mentorship, and just preparing my portfolio so that I could get my foot in\n      the door.\n    </div>\n  );\n\n  const Content = [\n    {\n      section: \"Putting prototyping on Blend's radar\",\n      content: [\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={accordion_tron}\n          caption=\"The Intuit Design Systems Accordion seen in Payments Onboarding with Chase in production\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          During my time at Intuit, I found an opportunity to prototype: I was\n          working on an {IDSAccordion} and when I was given the mocks from\n          design, all I saw was the ‘expanded’ and ‘collapsed’ states. My\n          initial thought was to sit with the designers and just ask all the\n          questions I could think of. What happens in between the\n          expand/collapse states? How long is the transition? What fades in and\n          what fades out? So on and so forth. I felt that this would be a good\n          time to try out Framer Classic since that was the ‘best’ tool on the\n          market out there, and I wanted to mock the experience before coding\n          it. It proved to be helpful since I could figure out all the\n          transitions, timings, and overall experience in Framer Classic while\n          not having to code the real thing. I could easily change values as\n          well to workshop the interaction in real time with the designers. This\n          process of working collaboratively with designers and rapidly\n          iterating on an interaction got me excited, and I wanted to do more of\n          that.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Fast forward a year, I embarked on my journey as a design technologist\n          at Blend. What happened to my goal to switch to becoming a product\n          designer? Well, I interviewed at Blend as a product designer, but I\n          wasn’t quite there yet in terms of experience. I was very interested\n          in prototyping as a function and just building concepts fast. To\n          blend, I was able to add immediate value by helping out and building\n          prototypes and demos. That sounded amazing to me, and despite going\n          into a role that I knew nothing about going into it, I don’t regret\n          any of that decision. I had no idea what design technology was at the\n          time, and quite frankly, I wasn’t sure if that was the right step for\n          me. However, I saw that I was given a chance to work on projects that\n          I could use my coding background to help iterate and flesh out\n          designs, so I decided to take the role and try it out.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          At Blend, my first few months were spent just exploring tooling for\n          prototyping. I wasn’t quite convinced that coding a prototype would be\n          the best or optimal option since tools like Framer Classic existed and\n          at that time Framer X just launched. I was super excited to try out\n          Framer X since leverages and incorporates ReactJS to make high\n          fidelity prototypes like this {bankerProto}. However, I found it to be\n          quite painful to use due to the lack of documentation and lack of a\n          few key features: passing data between screens, state management,\n          automatic page transitions (on load or with a setTimeout), and much\n          much much more. Despite the massive disappointment, I always kept\n          FramerX in the back of my head and tried to give it a chance over the\n          years. However, it ultimately morphed into a tool that I felt that did\n          not meet my needs.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption src={OTMBanner} caption=\"One-tap Mobile aka OTM\" />,\n        <div>\n          My main goal for prototyping remained the same regardless of if I used\n          FramerX, code, or another tool like ProtoPie (in which I will talk\n          about later): I really wanted to leverage code components to create\n          prototypes of the highest fidelity without having to remake or fake\n          prod level components with their interactions. I felt that high\n          fidelity prototypes should feel as real as possible, and I wanted to\n          use my technical background to make that a reality. I was able to\n          produce various prototypes like {OTM}, a prototype used for sales\n          demos and user tests for Blend’s one tap mortgage pre-approval\n          solution, or {WaitTaskV2}, an interactive loading state.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Over time, I was able to leverage Blend’s component library (in code)\n          to create prototypes quickly. When I first started out, there was only\n          a button, textbox, and a few other trivial components available in\n          consumer-components, one of blend’s component libraries. I found that\n          I needed at least a button, textinput, radio, and checkbox in order to\n          make flows quickly in code. Thus, I hacked together some components\n          from the monolith to have such components readily available in my\n          prototypes. I was able to demonstrate a fast turn-around time for\n          coded prototypes, in a matter of one or two weeks on average. I found\n          that I excelled in working with designers to workshop ideas, call out\n          inconsistencies within designs, and encourage designers to think\n          beyond static screens.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          I was able to create a framework to make mobile web prototypes faster\n          as well, mainly for my own sake, but also if anyone else came around\n          to wanting to prototype with code, there was a repo readily available\n          for consumption. The framework existed as just a simple git repo that\n          I could clone whenever I wanted to make a new prototype in which I\n          would deploy separately on netlify: that way, I could keep maintaining\n          or make changes when necessary. The framework included my basic\n          components that I used regularly, support to change theme/color and\n          branding easier for sales demos, have webpack and sass configured so I\n          didn’t have to run create react app every single time. I was also able\n          to leverage lottie for various loading states present in some of the\n          prototypes I worked with. These prototypes were meant to be as real as\n          possible so the use of Lottie helped us create and iterate on\n          animations faster. Furthermore, the inclusion of code made data input\n          as well as data processing on each prototype much much easier.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Over the course of a couple of quarters of heads down work, I was also\n          able to establish prototyping as a part of the design workflow. My\n          focus was to essentially help the design team prototype flows and\n          incorporate prototypes into their workflow (given the right scope and\n          resourcing). Through that, I was able to establish a process for\n          working with designers for prototyping as well as taking requests from\n          cross functional partners such as product managers and people from the\n          business development side of things.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={intake_form}\n          caption=\"Prototyping intake form for our XFN partners\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          My manager and I created an intake form for both XFN partners as well\n          as designers to send in prototyping requests when needed. On top of\n          that, we were able to establish a pre-read for XFN partners to\n          thoroughly think through their asks while considering time/cost\n          tradeoffs as well as having an understanding of what fidelity\n          prototypes and solutions we have available. One of the biggest points\n          of contention was that I was the only prototyping resource for Blend,\n          so it wasn’t viable to have me code all of my prototypes.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Having a pipeline/process as to what projects I prototype for as well\n          as helping designers and XFN members understand what solutions we have\n          and what tradeoffs come along with each solution really helped my job.\n          We found that this process helped our partners identify what kind of\n          prototype they desired (click through, coded, etc), what the timeline\n          was, and what the purpose of the prototype was. We found that there\n          were typically two buckets of prototypes: sales demos and prototypes\n          for user testing. We were thus able to not only create high fidelity\n          prototypes in a quick manner but also educate the design team as well\n          as the company about what the capabilities of prototyping are as well\n          as what kinds of solutions and prototypes are available.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={prototypingWithFidelityInMind}\n          white\n          caption=\"After participating in the seminar, I had a chance to share my learnings with the Product Design team.\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          From there, I felt that I wanted to empower the design team and help\n          make prototyping a bit more self serve. I had an opportunity to listen\n          in on a {prototypingPDF} created by the Nielsen Norman Group called\n          'Prototyping with Functional Fidelity in Mind'. The goal was to\n          ultimately help me learn more about prototyping and how to refine and\n          improve my process when it comes to working with partners for a\n          prototype. However, I felt that this could be a great way to further\n          educate the design team as to how to aid the with the collaboration\n          process when it comes to requesting specific prototypes. Through the\n          webinar, I was able to share out with the team that we need to\n          consider visual, content, and functional fidelity when considering\n          creating a prototype. Furthermore, the goal was to educate designers\n          the types of trade offs when it comes to using certain methods or\n          tools for prototyping as well as characteristics of what a high\n          functional fidelity prototype entails.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={OTMProtopie}\n          white\n          caption=\"Piloting Protopie for One Tap Mobile (OTM) to prototype sign-in and prefill experiences\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          Beyond the seminar, my goal for prototyping at blend was to also help\n          empower product designers to prototype on their own. Continuing my\n          explorations with prototyping tools, I came across ProtoPie, and I\n          found it to be a fairly decent no-code tool to help designers create\n          prototypes with high functional fidelity. ProtoPie ultimately lets you\n          create/store variables and have textInput fields and custom inputs\n          without having to write a single line of code. I thus tried using\n          ProtoPie for a {OTMProtopieLink} and found it quite straightforward to\n          use. From that, my manager and I set out to pilot ProtoPie for the\n          product design team as we found it to be a good avenue for product\n          designers at Blend to try and prototype on their own. If they required\n          help, I could help consult, and that would thus free up my time to\n          create more intricate or complex prototypes via code. We fundamentally\n          felt that designers should not be required to code, but we could at\n          least help designers get closer to producing prototypes without having\n          to code. We strongly encourage designers to know how to code, but\n          given the nature of working at a lively startup, we don’t always have\n          the time to do so. With ProtoPie, I found that it checked off all the\n          features that FramerX required as well as abstracting programming\n          concepts to make it more accessible.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          The introduction of ProtoPIe has served to be a quick and easy way to\n          test interactions for the product design team and serves as a tangible\n          way for the design technology team to help bring prototyping on\n          Blend’s radar beyond my skills. That’s about it for my prototyping\n          journey at Blend for now! I’ve thus moved on to working on design\n          systems at Blend, and have taken a small break from prototyping at\n          this time. Have questions? Drop me a line! I’m more than happy to\n          chat.\n        </div>,\n      ],\n    },\n  ];\n  return (\n    <Projects\n      title=\"Prototyping @ Blend\"\n      date=\"January 6th, 2021\"\n      summary={summaryText}\n      content={Content}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default PrototypingAtBlend;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SR_cover.ff3f55d9.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/roll_strat.30b11b77.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/roll_strat_mobile.5682f52e.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/colors.369a5bb3.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/landing_info.5463840c.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/roulette_form_inputs.73d31408.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/typography.48f38ab8.png\";","import React from 'react';\nimport Projects from '../../components/templates/prose/prose.component';\nimport { Text } from '../../components/text/text.component';\nimport { List } from '../../components/list/list.component';\nimport { ImageWithCaption } from '../../components/ImageWithCaption/ImageWithCaption.component';\nimport SR_cover from '../../assets/images/projects/StratRoulette/SR_cover.png';\nimport roll_strat from '../../assets/images/projects/StratRoulette/roll_strat.png';\nimport roll_strat_mobile from '../../assets/images/projects/StratRoulette/roll_strat_mobile.png';\nimport colors from '../../assets/images/projects/StratRoulette/colors.png';\nimport landing_info from '../../assets/images/projects/StratRoulette/landing_info.png';\nimport roulette_form_inputs from '../../assets/images/projects/StratRoulette/roulette_form_inputs.png';\nimport typography from '../../assets/images/projects/StratRoulette/typography.png';\nimport SRLegacy_alpha from '../../assets/images/projects/SRLegacy/SRLegacy_alpha.png';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nexport const StratRoulette = () => {\n  const Voyage = (\n    <a\n      className=\"action-link\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noreferrer\"\n      href={'https://vj-type.com/family/voyage/'}\n    >\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"we used Voyage\" />\n    </a>\n  );\n  const SRLegacy = (\n    <Link className=\"action-link\" to=\"/SRLegacy\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <Text size=\"link-1\" text=\"a previous attempt in 2017 was made\" />\n    </Link>\n  );\n  const summaryText = (\n    <div>\n      <ImageWithCaption\n        src={SR_cover}\n        caption=\"StratRoulette is a platform where users can submit strats to a community for various competitive e-sports games like CounterStrike, Valorant, and more.\"\n      />\n      StratRoulette (SR) has been a side project that I've been working on with\n      my good friend Justin Chen.

I really just wanted an\n          excuse to pick a sick typeface, {Voyage}, pick out a few colors, and\n          build a bunch of components while making all the design decisions.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Basically, I wanted to just build an application with ui elements that\n          I found interesting from work or just randomly browsing the internet.\n          A big part of this was also to just revisit my work from 2017, and\n          really just “do better” because, oh boy, it was really really bad.

I really wanted to apply all the things that I\n          learned from design systems and apply it to SR as an exercise for me\n          to grow. I really wanted to just build something from the ground up on\n          both design and code to really get a feel of what it’s like to build\n          and maintain a system.

Furthermore, I wanted to pick out the\n          branding and design language of the application. During that time, I\n          was working at Blend, and most of Blend’s application was white-label.\n          Thus, I wanted to be able to pick out colors, typeface, and other\n          design elements.\n        </div>,\n        <div>\n          Once the colors, typeface, and design elements were figured out, I\n          decided to create a logo.

As for type, I\n          really just fell in love with Voyage, and was really into the trend of\n          having a serif header/display font. Color was really just arbitrary,\n          but I was feeling a light purple at the time, and I certainly did not\n          want a blue color since most fin-tech startups use blue. Red, green,\n          and yellow, really did not vibe with me since they reflect error,\n          success, and warning colors respectively.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={colors}\n          caption=\"StratRoulette's color system\"\n        />,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={typography}\n          caption=\"StratRoulette's type ramp showcasing Voyage for Display text Inter for body and subheaders\"\n        />,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={roulette_form_inputs}\n          caption=\"Roulette design system's form inputs.\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          For most of the project, SR’s design and product decisions were driven\n          by Justin and me. Justin created various product specs, and during the\n          design phase, we would discuss features and how they would work.\n          Features would entail supporting and improving legacy features and\n          also new features to improve the overall application experience.\n          Before designing screens/flows, I first created a base set of\n          components\n        </div>,\n\n        <div>\n          I explored concepts for the type ramp since I knew that the main focus\n          of the application was the strat card. This was the whole basis of SR\n          - provide a user a ‘strat’ to play for a game. Additionally, I was\n          able to explore concepts for the brand page as well as basic input\n          components to land on a type ramp. Colors were quite arbitrary since I\n          made the decision to keep the application simple and only have one\n          primary color and eventually adding an accent color. Neutral colors\n          were selected and checked for contrast to meet AA WCAG compliance. We\n          decided to go with the standard 8px grid to create most of our\n          elements.\n        </div>,\n\n        <div>\n          Once the fundamental design elements were created, I then started\n          designing basic inputs like buttons, radio, and others to thus have\n          some components to work with when designing flows. I figured that it’d\n          be much faster to design screens when I had at least the design tokens\n          and a few components figured out as opposed to designing both\n          components and flows at the same time.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={landing_info}\n          caption=\"StratRoulette's info section on the landing page.\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          Prior to working on the core product, I also took some time to work on\n          the landing page because I was super inspired company landing pages\n          and I just wanted to run wild with a concept. I really just wanted to\n          make something simple yet aesthetic in my own way. I was able to\n          design and implement the brand page, and it was a blast to run wild on\n          the design and code fronts.\n        </div>,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={roll_strat}\n          caption=\"StratRoulette's roll strat screen displaying a strat card.\"\n        />,\n        <ImageWithCaption\n          src={roll_strat_mobile}\n          caption=\"StratRoulette's roll strat page on mobile\"\n        />,\n        <div>\n          After the brand page, I focused solely on designing flows ranging from\n          logging in to rolling a strat. Alongside designing, I also began\n          developing components for the design system. We tried to parallelize\n          designing of features as well as coding components so that we could\n          build pages faster later. Therefore, we set out features each week\n          that we wanted to tackle, and beforehand, we would call out what\n          components needed to be implemented before the feature could then be\n          developed. Additionally, we added the design tokens in code and made\n          sure those were ready before we could create components. Each feature\n          was then designed, components were coded and added to storybook, and\n          then pages were coded.\n        </div>,\n      ],\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <Projects\n      title=\"StratRoulette\"\n      date=\"March 2020 - Present\"\n      summary={summaryText}\n      content={StratRouletteContent}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default StratRoulette;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { HashRouter, Redirect, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Main } from './pages/Main/Main';\nimport { Photography } from './pages/Photography/Photography';\nimport UnderConstruction from './pages/UnderConstruction/UnderConstruction.component';\nimport NotFound from './pages/NotFound/NotFound.component';\nimport OTM from './pages/Projects/OTM';\nimport IDSAccordion from './pages/Projects/IDSAccordion';\nimport DocUploader from './pages/Projects/DocUploader';\nimport SRLegacy from './pages/Projects/SRLegacy';\nimport WaitTAskV2 from './pages/Projects/WaitTaskV2';\nimport AbstractMigrate from './pages/Projects/AbstractMigrate';\nimport Sapling from './pages/Projects/Sapling';\nimport Haven from './pages/Projects/Haven';\nimport DesignSystemsAtBlend from './pages/Blog/DesignSystemsAtBlend';\nimport PrototypingAtBlend from './pages/Blog/PrototypingAtBlend';\nimport StratRoulette from './pages/Projects/StratRoulette';\n\n// import DesignSystemsAtBlend from './pages/Blog/designSystemsAtBlend';\n\nexport const App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <HashRouter>\n        <Switch>\n          <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Main} />\n          <Route path=\"/photography\" component={Photography} />\n          <Route path=\"/underconstruction\" component={UnderConstruction} />\n          <Route path=\"/OTM\" component={OTM} />\n          <Route path=\"/IDSAccordion\" component={IDSAccordion} />\n          <Route path=\"/DocUploader\" component={DocUploader} />\n          <Route path=\"/SRLegacy\" component={SRLegacy} />\n          <Route path=\"/404\" component={NotFound} />\n          <Route path=\"/WaitTaskV2\" component={WaitTAskV2} />\n          <Route path=\"/AbstractMigrate\" component={AbstractMigrate} />\n          <Route path=\"/Sapling\" component={Sapling} />\n          <Route path=\"/Haven\" component={Haven} />\n          <Route path=\"/StratRoulette\" component={StratRoulette} />\n          <Route path=\"/Alchemy\" component={UnderConstruction} />\n\n          <Route\n            path=\"/DesignSystemsAtBlend\"\n            component={DesignSystemsAtBlend}\n          />\n          <Route path=\"/PrototypingAtBlend\" component={PrototypingAtBlend} />\n          <Redirect from=\"*\" to=\"/404\" />\n          {/* <Route path=\"/dsystemsAtBlend\" component={DesignSystemsAtBlend} /> */}\n        </Switch>\n      </HashRouter>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.scss';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    <App />\n  </BrowserRouter>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\nreportWebVitals();\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
