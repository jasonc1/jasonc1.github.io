        <p> Chartly is a project that I wanted to experiment with further developing this sort of broken down or progressive
          workflow. Granted, this was during the time I made VIEWFINDER, so I was still really fascinated by such a concept
          that I wanted to apply it to another project. Thus, I made Chartly, a tool that could essentially make fake charts
          for people without requiring a user to pull random numbers out of thin air. I noticed, at least during my time
          in school, I had to make random mock charts or make static mock UIs on illustrator for prototyping with Invision,
          and sometimes when it came to creating tables or showing data, I did not want to draw out a chart or table by hand.
          With that, I wanted to create a small tool that could potentially shave a few minutes off of someone’s workflow.
          Furthermore, I had two other incentives when it came to this project: I wanted to have some excuse to play with
          <a class="project-link" href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank">Chart.js</a> because I thought it was so pretty of a library and I wanted to design something and prototype it from
          paper prototypes to actually something that can run in chrome.

        <h3 class="projects-label">Process</h3>
        <p>Chartly was a project that I tried to take it from paper prototype all the way to a working prototype in chrome.
          I wanted to not only work fast, but I also wanted to get past just using InVision, but also making as close to
          the real thing as I could. I wanted to see how far I could develop some sort of working prototype with the javascript
          and web design knowledge I had while still delivering something that would be easy to use and somewhat pratical.
          Furthermore, I wanted to make something that could try and abstract a javascript library so that a non technical
          person could still produce aesthetically pleasing charts for whatever assets they need.
        </p>
        <p>Things I focused on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Starting from paper prototype to a functioning web page
          </li>
          <li>
            Chartly acts as a medium for users to interface with Chart.js
          </li>
          <li>Progressive like workflow, guiding the user through a step by step process
          </li>
          <li>Responsive and mobile first design
          </li>
          <li>Various forms of input</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, part of the inspiration for Chartly was Airbnb’s flow for searching for house listings. I really enjoyed
          how it guided the user step by step and also removed the distractions of filling out a huge form. I really wanted
          to replicate something like this, and from a high level point of view, Chartly is just a fancy UI that configures
          and provides a bunch of parameters to Chart.js, which then spits out a chart that a user could download from. However,
          I did not want to have the user be overwhelmed by a “huge” list of parameters that they needed to choose from in
          order to produce a functioning chart or graph. As a side note, looking back at this project, I still find these
          issues relevant to my life: when it comes to configuring a component from a ui library, it may be hard to figure
          out what can be done or how it is done. Things like StoryBook can show realtime as to what can be configured. As
          for Chartly, I wanted to make this process as frictionless as possible, without requiring the user to have any
          technical knowledge or a dataset handy in order to make their chart.

        <h3 class="projects-label">Screens</h3>
        <img class="project-page-image" src="../img/projects/chartly_paper.png" />

        <p>First I started out with some paper prototypes, and overall I just tried to keep it simple: I had a home page with
          a few options for what chart a user wanted. Chart.js has a wide variety of charts to pick from, but I just decided
          to stick with a few of the popular ones: line, bar, radar, and pie chart. From my paper prototypes, I focused on
          iterating through the pie chart flow. I want to point out that this layout is very similar to that of VIEWFINDER
          since the home page has a few action items as well as a help button to educate the user what the app does, and
          the app also has a progress bar/counter at the bottom of each step. Overall, most individuals liked the idea, so
          I simply moved on to the screen designing and invision prototype.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="one column">
          </div>
          <div class="four columns">
            <img src="../img/projects/chartly_proto-01.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="two columns">
          </div>
          <div class="four columns">
            <img src="../img/projects/chartly_proto-02.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="one column">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>When I made the homepage, I was still in the “parallax” phase, but not so much with moving pictures. I just wanted
          to background that filled the page, and I squiggled some lines that reminisced a line graph and intersected them
          at one point and layered them with colors so that it looked like a chart. I wanted Chartly to look playful and
          welcoming, and I really wanted to do something that didnt have a white, grey, or black background. Since Chart.js
          has a really vibrant color scheme, I decided to adopt a handful of their colors and have the primary color be pink
          for the background.
        </p>
        <p>From there, I decided to make the help screen, as I wanted to at least have some sort of explanation to the user
          before or during the time they used the app. The help screen was quite simple: it had some text explaining what
          Chartly does, and it also has a short blurb of what each chart could be used for. This help page is accessible
          through the landing page or the home page. As for the menu page, the user is given four options, and each would
          roughly follow the same type of flow when creating the respective chart.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="four columns">

          </div>
          <div class="four columns">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>When it came to making all of the screens for invision and then sequentially user testing the design on a few people,
          most of the feedback was positive; however people pointed out that for all my graphs, they should try to follow
          the same steps. For example, every chart should start out with asking for the name, so that things could remain
          consistent. Another issue that I discovered was that I should combine the color and the label for a certain data
          point. I don’t have a picture to show what it was before, but I broke up the steps so that the user would first
          provide label names for something like each bar in the bar graph, and the next step would be to assign colors.
          This was remediated by thus combining both inputs: allowing the user to create a label name along with a color.
        </p>
        <h3 class="projects-label">Web Development // Prototype</h3>
        <p>
          For web design and development portion of the project, I decided to focus most of my efforts on just perfecting one workflow:
          the bar chart, as it would be interesting to ask the user if they wanted a border, color for each bar, etc, and
          I got to experiment with styling inputs so that it would provide the user an easier way to configure their chart.
          The first step was to ask for the name of the chart, which is quite self explanatory. During each step of the process,
          there was always a way for the user to go back and edit their inputs.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/projects/chartly_desk3.png" />

        <p>The next section was for the y-axis of the bar graph: what was the min and max values of the bar graph. I created
          a small image so that the user knew what the min and max values correspond to for the bar graph. Then, Chartly
          asked for the number of bars needed in the graph. This was done in a way so that the first bar was default mandatory
          to make the chart. Thus, the first bar input was populated, and there is an option to add more bars. With each
          consecutive bar input added, there would be an X to allow the user to remove them. Each bar input consisted of
          a bar name (text field) and a color (color picker). I had a set list of colors (maybe 10) that would just be automatically
          set just so the user would not have to spend time on picking colors, but I added the color picker to allow the
          user to choose their colors if they wanted to do so. Similar to the the y-axis inputs, I added a graphic to show
          that the inputs were for the x-axis.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/projects/chartly_desk2.png" />

        <p>After the number of bars were determined and the min max values, the chart essentially could have been generated.
          However, the last argument needed for a chart was if the user wanted a bar border or not. There was a default value
          associated to Chart.js, so it was not a required value, but I wanted to play around styling a slider. I wanted
          to incorporate a slider that displayed when the user checked “Yes” for the borders. When the slider moved up and
          down, an integer would increase or decrease based on the range, which corresponds to how thick the borders were.
          I struggled with trying to figure out a way to show the line thickness, as I first thought the integer values were
          enough. I thought about showing something in addition of the integer increasing or decreasing like an actual bar
          with a border increasing or decreasing with border size, but due to the interest of time, I just went without adding
          anything, as I wasn’t even sure what the unit was or what a typical user would think it would be. Once the border
          thickness was set, the user would be able to see the chart. From there, the user could save/copy the chart, edit
          the chart, or go to the main menu.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/projects/chartly_desk1.png" />
        <p>Under the hood, Chartly runs a random number generator that takes the min and max values and based on how many bars
          are needed an integer, name, color, and border thickness are assigned to each bar. I made Chartly with a bunch
          of javascript functions that were added on to the onClick event handlers for each button I had. For example, every
          time “add label” was clicked during the x-axis portion of the bar chart, a javascript function would manipulate
          the DOM so that another bar label would be added. Every time a user clicked “next” during the step flow, Chartly
          would essentially hide a div and show a new div (how primitive! I know). When I made chartly, I thought about using
          a framework like AngularJS, but when it came down to configuring the project and stringing everything together,
          I simply got bogged down by the technologies, so I decided to just do everything in plain old javascript, and no
          jQuery. This definitely was not the most efficient use of my time at first, but when it came to making something
          fast, I was able to produce this in a matter of days, and the bulk of the time spent coding was just making sure
          I was able to properly configure a json object to pass into Chart.js to produce a chart or styling my inputs so
          that they looked like my designs. As mentioned before, Chartly is a medium that allows a user to interface with
          Chart.js, so most of the inputs took a slice of the json object that Chart.js needed and was responsible for that
          piece. As each of the inputs are filled out, Chartly updates the json step by step and thus creating a chart for
          the user.
