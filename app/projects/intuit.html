        <p> At Intuit, my team works on the onboarding flow for getting Quickbooks customers signed up with Payments, so essentially
          we deal with everything related to a sign up page. My focus during my time at intuit is to learn as much as I can
          about React + Redux, but also be a driver in providing a good user experience.

        <h3 class="projects-label">DocUploader</h3>
        <p>DocUploader is one of the first ‘big’ contributions towards Intuit within my first year. I had roughly 4 weeks to
          develop the UI from scratch, and this was my first project that I owned.</p>
        <p>As part of the onboarding process, about 10% of customers sign up need to verify their identity by providing a form
          of Identification Document (Passport, Driver License, etc). The previous process was that the customer had to call
          customer care and fax/email their documentation, which took roughly 24-48 hours to complete, depending on what
          was needed. With DocUploader, the customer was able to attach a picture and send it online without having to talk
          to a care agent. This significantly reduced the time, as a process that took 24-48 hours was cut down to about
          10 minutes. Roughly 200+ uploads were made within the first month, and that saved Intuit about at least $5,000
          at $25 per care call. However, the most important part was that we were able to save the user’s time as well as
          care agents’ time.
        </p>
        <p>Creating the UI took roughly 1.5 weeks, but testing the UI took the other 2.5 weeks. For the most part, everything
          was self explanatory, but as I developed, I really wanted to make sure that this was a usable product, so I tried
          to engage myself in discussions with the designers. </p>

        <p>Design issues that surfaced during development:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dragging and dropping was a feature that was requested, but I realized that there was nothing in place with the design/prototype
            to reflect to a user that as they are dragging their file, they need to know where the file is going to drop.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This was mainly a problem for driver licenses since there needed to be a front and a back, thus creating two drop areas.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Another issue was that only one error message was provided in the design spec: if the file selected was too big.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We needed to account for things like invalid file types and drag/dropping multiple files.
            </li>
            <li>
              This was not so much an engineering issue, so the fix was just to provide a proper error message to let the user know what
              they did wrong.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>A valuable thing that I learned from this project was to not only be able to manage expectations between my PM and
          manager but also be able to develop the leadership skills to collaborate with my team and designers to get this
          out to production.

          <h3 class="projects-label">Intuit Design Systems [IDS] Accordion Component</h3>
          <p>Initially, I volunteered to take up a task to research what it would take to make an accordion component for a new onboarding flow my team was going to work on. After doing all the research and having countless meetings with the designers to figure out every single edge case that the accordion would have, I really wanted to build that component. Due to my NDA, I cannot show what it looks like just yet, as it is not officially released even within Intuit, but stay tuned!
            </p>
          <p>My ultimate goal was to not only make a component that my team can use, but also make a component that could be potentially used by other teams. As I found out, this accordion design is a design pattern that would be used throughout all of Quickbooks, and there was a bare bones version of an accordion that I could build on top of.
          </p>
          <p>Key Features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Utilize a version of an existing accordion and modify it so that it is customizable for the consumer
            </li>
            <li>
                Collaboration with motion designers to be consistent with Intuit’s new motion design guidelines
            </li>
            <li>
                Customizable to different themes to match Intuit’s respective products
            </li>
            <li>
                Working towards graduation for officially being a part of Intuit Design Systems
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                  Upgraded project to React 16
                </li>
                <li>
                    Collaboration with Accessibility team to meet Intuit’s standards=
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide help and information externally to other teams for consumption
                </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <p>My initial thought was to not use the existing accordion, but the more I did my research the more it made sense: the bare bones version would be a part of the intuit design system, it was made so that it could be customizable (with a few improvements), and it would not require to make something from scratch. This was something I only found out after going back and forth as to if should make a component from scratch, or leverage something that has the basic functionality in place. The bare bones accordion was definitely not an exact match, but after collaborating with the developer, we were able to make it so that the consumers of the accordion had full control as to what the header and body components would have. My further contributions were to pass in props in the react component to be able to provide the styling for the Quickbooks wide accordion. I also developed a theme provider so that this accordion style could take up different themes based on whatever product it was used for: mint, quickbooks, turbo tax, etc. 
          </p>
          <p>
              At the end of the contribution, I was able to make something that could be used throughout Intuit, as I felt that it would be ultimately inefficient for another team to develop the same thing. In fact, multiple teams were designing new UIs with the accordion style that my team was using. This accordion currently sits as a lab component, but once two teams use it and it meets proper code coverage, it will be graduated into IDS officially, and it will be packaged into every project automatically as currently it is available in Intuit’s npm registry meaning developers have to install it manually.
