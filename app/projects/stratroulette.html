        <p> StratRoulette [SR] is a project created by my good friend Justin Chen from CMU. SR essentially rolls the dice for
          you and randomly decides, based on community sourced plays or strats, how you should play each round of CounterStrike.
          I primarily work on and in a way pioneer StratRoulette’s identity and feature development, but I also take part
          in the front end development in React. StratRoulette took off a few years back, and my friend asked me to do a
          redesign to not only develop some sort of identity but also create and design user flows that would help foster
          community engagement.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h3 class="projects-label">Process</h3>
        <p>The first order of business for StratRoulette was for me to create a logo. The biggest motivation for me was to not
          make it look to “gamer,” and also not too boring. What I shortly realized was that making some sort of logo or
          monogram with the letters “S” and “R” were quit tricky.
        </p>
        <p>The first iterations were based on a hexagonal shape, similar to a revolver barrel. I wanted to really emphasize
          the roulette part, and I thought it would be interesting with the idea “russian roulette.” However, it was hard
          for me to execute and figure out where the S would ultimately be.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="five columns">
          </div>
          <div class="two columns">
            <img src="../img/projects/stratroulette_logo_2.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="five columns">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Then, I tried more of a symmetric approach, as I tried to make the S and the R shapes look more similar, but it just
          seemed to take too much space</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="five columns">
          </div>
          <div class="two columns">
            <img src="../img/projects/stratroulette_logo_6-01.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="five columns">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Next was some sort of lightning bolt to convey the fast paced nature of SR, and the R was placed as more of an exponent and
          not the main focus.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="five columns">
          </div>
          <div class="two columns">
            <img src="../img/projects/stratroulette_logo_4-01.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="five columns">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          However, the last iteration was something completely unorthodox. I was really inspired by something like Parley’s icons with
          some sort of circle border, and I just toyed around with switching the emphasis of the letters. Ultimately, I came
          to this by just trying it out, but I seemed to like it more: the letter “R” seemed to fit better with a Circle,
          as it wasn’t clashing with either sharp edges or curved edges of the bends. This logo is used for the main page,
          as well as the favicon. Note that the favicon does not have the “StratRoulette” text in the circle, as it is too
          small to be read or seen.

        <p>After doing the logos, I really wanted to make sure the whole website was made so that it could be catered towards
          different types of games, as we were thinking of expanding from CS:GO. I ultimately was just tired of seeing really
          bright or neon and crazy looking text on websites to fit the brand of the game, and since SR is not really tied
          to a game, I figured I could just start from scratch and keep it minimal. I first just started out by picking some
          colors, really just anything I felt, and at that time I felt like electric blue and a dark black/grey would be
          pretty fitting as accent colors. All the icons made in SR were also created by me with a little bit of illustrator
          magic.

        <p>Then came mainfunctionality of the application, which consisted of the landing, profile, settings, home, login, and a few more. I first started out
          creating the landing page, which showcases what the product does: rolling strats, but I also wanted to showcase
          and get people to sign up. So I followed the typical three column/icon approach to showcase StratRoulettes features.
          However, the most important part was to showcase the Strat card because it was the one thing that users directly
          interacted with. We wanted to show what new things we added: color coding towards games, a save and share button,
          tags, etc, and furthermore this would be a component that shows up everywhere.
        </p>
        <img class="project-page-image" src="../img/projects/HOME.png" />

        <p>While keeping in mind that React could reuse components, I wanted to make sure my design could be used anywhere in
          the website. Thus moving on to the home page, it is quite similar to something you see Facebook or Soundcloud.
          We wanted to show the activity feeds of people that a user follow and show what Strats are being favorited or created.
          Essentially this page is where people share strat cards, playbooks (collections of strats), and more. I was ultimately
          inspired by how SoundCloud takes the “social media” approach of sharing music, where people post songs or repost
          songs, instead of acting like a typical music library. The same goes for SR, we wanted it to act not only as a
          repository of strats that people contribute, but we want to be able to showcase them and share them easily.
        </p>
        <img class="project-page-image white-image" src="../img/projects/STRAT_card.png" />
        <p>
          We wanted to provide a way for people to contribute strats, search/filter for strats, roll strats (when they play the game), and comment on strats. We are
          still in the process of building out the product, so designing has stopped for now, and we are focusing on the
          landing and home pages. Stay tuned for more updates.
