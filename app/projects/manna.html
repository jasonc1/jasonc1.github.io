        <p> Manna was a project done in conjunction with Professor Heimann from CMU. This project was done as an independent
          study with the guidance of my professor, and it was mostly a solo project on my end. From start to finish, I was
          responsible for the development of the web application Prof H identified a problem within his Church, ACAC Pittsburgh,
          and tasked me to do create an application that would simplify the process of countless email threads and attachments
          to a system where Deacons of the church could open cases to provide aid for someone and attach relevant documents
          so that other Deacons could vote and discuss.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="two columns">

          </div>
          <div class="ten columns">
            <p>Deacons provide monetary aid to members in the church through writing an application and having other deacons
              discuss and vote on whether or not the aid should be granted. <strong>This process happened all over email or text,
              thus causing a rift in organization as discussions and votes were clouded by countless emails all under one
              thread.</strong> Furthermore, requesting documents or follow ups to a topic made it impossible to track for users. Each
              case needed Deacon's to vote on, and ensuring that every deacon was not only informed but also involved with
              the discussion was crucial. With numerous cases being presented weekly, sometimes cases fell out of the spotlight
              as more cases came in, so keeping deacons on top of what cases needed attention was also a huge pain point.

          </div>
          <div class="ten columns">
            <p>A web application was needed so that deacons could manage cases all in one place. This web application needed
              to solve for two things: providing a space for discussion and also organize documents related to cases as well
              as individuals. This web application needed to organize cases so that deacons can look up current or past cases.
              Furthermore, this application needed to cater towards an older audience, so it had to be easy to use as well
              as simple.

            <p>Project Requirements:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mobile first design so that deacons [users] could access this through their smartphones
              </li>
              <li>
                Have some way to attach files or photos
              </li>
              <li>Needed to have a voting system and comment system
              </li>
              <li>Index all cases, index cases by client, search all cases
              </li>
              <li>Show cases that need review and recent cases on the home pages</li>

            <p>The first few days of the project were to create the database needed for this application, so I made an ERD and
              created a developmental database on SQL lite for the purposes of this project. Key tables were that there had
              to be users, which were the deacons, and each deacon could create cases online. Each case would have document(s)
              that could be attached and each case would have a vote count.
            </p>
            <img class="project-page-image white-image" src="../img/projects/ERD_draft.png" />

            <p>From there, I started designing the UI for the application. Overall, it was quite simple, and I based my designs
              on something a little more minimal from something like
              <a class="project-link" href="http://udfore.com/" target="_blank">UDFORE</a>. I primarily started my designs from a mobile screen, as the focus was to make sure the mobile experience
              was worthwhile. When the mobile screens were done, I simply just “enlarged” the sections to fit a webpage.
              I tried to keep the designs simple since I wanted to just make sure that it was functional yet it could easily
              resize and be responsive towards all screens. I also made an invision app with intentions of user testing with
              deacons, but since Prof H was a deacon and due to time constraints, he gave the go ahead to proceed.</p>

            <h3 class="projects-label">Home Page</h3>
            <img class="project-page-image white-image" src="../img/projects/manna_mediumFi_desktop.png" />
            <p>The home page was an important aspect of application because it served as a way to remind deacons as to what
              cases needed their attention. A general use case would be the following: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>user logs into Manna</li>
              <li>Home page shows cases that need review, and deacon selects case</li>
              <li>user reads the case description and documents</li>
              <li>user then adds a comment by using the Disqus plugin</li>
              <li>if the user is ready to vote, user clicks on the 'votes' section and selects yes or no</li>
            </ol>

            <p>From the home page, a user could go through the nav bar and submit an application or look up all cases, recent
              cases, or cases by client. The purpose of the home page was to show the important cases that needed immediate
              attention, but also provide a way so that a user could do other actions if needed.</p>
            <p>One thing I struggled with when designing was the Nav bar itself. I wanted the logo to be centered with buttons
              under it on mobile, but on computer screens, I wanted them to be separate so that it would take up space and
              act as a long nav bar. For the sake of time, I did not want to deal with collapsing the nav bar buttons into
              a hamburger bar, and since there were only a few actions, it felt okay to keep the buttons the same size for
              mobile and for web.
            </p>
            <h3 class="projects-label">Voting &amp; Discussing Cases</h3>

            <p>A big ask was that whenever a case was created, there needed to be a comments or discussion section as well as
              a voting portion. The basis for this application was so that deacons could not only create cases for people,
              but also vote and discuss about them so that they did not have to meet up in person. <strong>In order to further cut
              down implementation time, I leveraged Disqus’ platform</strong>, as they had a package built for Ruby on Rails. With
              that, I was able to attach a thread to each case, but not have to worry about managing and adding more to the
              database design, as well as creating a whole content system that involves with editing, replying to, etc.

                <img class=" white-image" src="../img/projects/manna_case2.png" />
              </div>
              <div class="four columns">
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>When it came down to the voting, I had to focus on two parts: making sure that each user can only vote once but
              can change their vote if needed, and disable voting for closed cases. The voting itself was quite easy as it
              was just incrementing an integer tied to a case for both Yes and No votes. I built it so that the user would
              only have one vote, and if they change their vote, it would remove the previous vote and add the new vote to
              the respective category. If i were to do this again, I think I would at least make it more obvious to the user
              that this is happening. Voting was a small modal that popped up to allow the user to just click either yes
              or no, and the voting section would update itself afterwards. Another aspect that I would change is that the
              voting section on each case page was just a number as “3 | 2.” It is not really obvious to all that the green
              means yes and the red means no, and furthermore the only way for a user to vote is to click on the section
              itself, which may not be that intuitive. Granted, the system would be used for roughly 20 people, and they
              would all be onboarded, but this would be a case where I tried to make things a little too minimal, which may
              add friction to a user.

            </p>
            <h3 class="projects-label">Selecting Deacons &amp; clients</h3>
            <p>Creating a case was also the main focus of this project, as it needed to be easy to fill out. I wanted to streamline this process so that time could be spent discussing cases more so drafting or creating a case. Thus, the case creation page was rather reduced to the bare minimum: subject, client, deacon, description, and files attached. One quality of life improvement was that the <strong>deacon section would be autofilled based on account</strong>, and it would exist as a dropdown menu: there were only about 10-15 deacons, thus the list was manageable. The drop down was necessary so that deacons could also help create cases for other deacons, which was common due to time constraints. Clients, on the other hand, were harder to manage, and due to the interest of time, they were kept as just a normal text box. We wanted to minimize collisions with clients with the same name, so we kept it up to the deacon to provide a proper name that could identify a client properly.

            <h3 class="projects-label">Attaching Files</h3>

            <p>Another challenging aspect of this project was actually attaching a file or multiple files to each case. First
              off, I never really had any experience with attaching files and making sure they get sent to a database: at
              most, it was just attaching a file to an input tag and calling it a day. With this project, <strong>I had to make sure
              there was a way to attach multiple files, and provide a way to show what was attached and a way to remove it
              if needed.</strong> As anyone would say, styling input tags is quite tricky because usually there’s a “choose button”
              and a section that shows a file type. However, I had to have a button that triggered the file selector if there
              were no files attached, and for each file that was attached, a user could either delete it by clicking “X”
              or change it by clicking on the file name itself. When it came to actually viewing a case, a list of underlined
              document names were shown, so when a user clicked on the name, it would open a new tab and show the document.
