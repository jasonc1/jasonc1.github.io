                    <b>Overview</b>
                    <p>The CMU Sports Analytics Club reached out to me to redesign their website, as at that time, they were just recognized as a club, and had some more resources to rework their website.
                    </p>

                    <b>The Issue</b>
                    <p>Essentially, the website needed some redesigning, as it was outdated. Their previous website was on Wordpress, and not many people either knew how to manage it or use it to it's fullest potential.
                    </p>

                    <b>Process</b>
                    <p>I started off this project with some basic sketches of what I would want the website to be.
                    <div class = "sketch">
                        <img src = "../img/Portfolio/sports.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class = "sketch">
                        <img src = "../img/Portfolio/sports1.jpg"/>
                    </div>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    However, after several discussions with the club, we deduced that it was just better to stick with WordPress. I was at first thinking of making a static page, as I at first did not know what their website would be used for, but I learned that their website was mainly used to publish content almost every 2-3 days. With that, we decided to stick with Wordpress.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Wordpress, however was hard to wrangle around. There is nothing really to show about this aspect, but it was hard to manipulate the html/css. Furthermore, not all the functions were available because the website was a ".com" and not a ".org" so many plugins were not available. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Overall, there were some perks using wordpress: the users could still update articles with ease, as Wordpress works as a decent CMS, and I was also able to integrate a twitter feed and some other features easily.
