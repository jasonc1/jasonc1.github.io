                Hi, I'm Jason, and this is my portfolio. I'm more or less some sort of developer that is passionate about building things fast and turning design mocks into prototypes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017 with a B.S. in Information Systems and a B.S. in Human Computer Interaction. I am currently a Software Engineer at Intuit stationed in Mountain View, CA. I work on the the UI for getting Quickbooks customers signed up for Payments. You can find my resume <a href="misc/jason_chen_resume_2017.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> or scroll down.

            <p>
                Some of my hobbies include analog photography, music, design, and working out. You can checkout my instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/me.dium/" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to shoot me an email at jasonc1@alumni.cmu.edu to talk anything about code, UI/UX, photography (both digital and analog), or anything else.

            Neferirkare Kakai (known in Greek as Nefercherês, Νεφερχέρης) was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty. Neferirkare, the eldest son of Sahure with his consort Meretnebty, was known as Ranefer A before he came to the throne. He acceded the day after his father's death and reigned for eight to eleven years, sometime in the early to mid-25th century BCE. He was himself very likely succeeded by his eldest son, born of his queen Khentkaus II, the prince Ranefer B who would take the throne as king Neferefre. Neferirkare fathered another pharaoh, Nyuserre Ini who took the throne after Neferefre's short reign and the brief rule of the poorly known Shepseskare.
            </p>
            <p>
            Neferirkare was acknowledged by his contemporaries as a kind and benevolent ruler, intervening in favour of his courtiers after a mishap. His rule witnessed a growth in the number of administration and priesthood officials, who used their expanded wealth to build architecturally more sophisticated mastabas, where they recorded their biographies for the first time. Neferirkare was the last pharaoh to significantly modify the standard royal titulary, separating the nomen or birth name, from the prenomen or throne name. From his reign onwards, the former was written in a cartouche preceded by the "Son of Ra" epithet. His rule witnessed continuing trade relations with Nubia to the south and possibly with Byblos on the Levantine coast to the north.
