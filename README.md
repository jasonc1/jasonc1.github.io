# Overview

This is the repo to my portfolio website - designed and created by me. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## DEPLOYMENT

### `yarn deploy`

This will create a build and push it to the `prod` branch, in which Github will serve and host the live site.
