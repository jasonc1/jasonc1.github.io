      Haven is a figma plugin I built to help product designers document and
      protect their explorations and archived screens as well as tagging screens
      for better handoff. Haven was a small side project and an opportunity to
      explore tooling for the Product design team within Figma.

          One of the issues that product designers face at Blend (I'm sure this
          is probably an issue at other startups as well) is having to design
          features within a short turnaround and in fringe cases, old
          explorations (we’re talking multiple years) would be mistaken as
          design specs. Additionally, exploration files of current working files
          would be mistaken as a spec, thus causing throw away work due to a
          simple mix up.

          Haven’s conception mainly came out of two primary reasons: one was to
          help product designers ‘protect’ their work by making explicit call
          outs to exploratory work and another reason was to expand Design
          Technology’s support within Product Design at Blend. I primarily took
          this as an opportunity to support the Product Design team beyond
          design systems. I’ve previously made the {AbstractMigrate} tool to
          help with the migration off of Sketch + Abstract and on to Figma. My
          next personal goal was to learn how to make a Figma Plugin, and upon
          learning of a few of the issues that Product Designer’s faced, I chose
          to make Haven for the team, and use it as a learning experience for my
          own growth as well.

          Haven makes it easy for designers to add one of two overlays:
          “EXPLORATION” or “ARCHIVE”. The overlays added will resize based on
          the selected frames, and the text size as well as the text itself can
          be modified. Additionally, designers can also add ‘tags’ above each
          frame to label frames as “Needs Review,” “Prod Ready,” or a custom
          label. Designers just have to select the frames they’d like to label,
          run the plugin, and configure what the label or overlay will say.
