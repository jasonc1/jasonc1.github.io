        The designs presented were simply done through sketch; thus, things like easing (animation) as well as accessbility were not

        multiple pages, thus forcing a user with a very rigid flow.`}

        teams. This accordion was a crucial component in a sense that it could
        provide users flexibility when it came to filling out forms: a form
        broken down to sections that could not only summarize each section but
        also provide the user the freedom to preview what they need to
        accomplish and to start wherever they desired. This accordion was made
        so that custom header and body content could be used so that consumers
        of this component had full control as to what they want to display to
        the user. This is powerful so that the accordion could be dynamic:
        different states of the accordion could show different content. Key features include:`}

        team was using. This accordion currently sits as a lab component, but
