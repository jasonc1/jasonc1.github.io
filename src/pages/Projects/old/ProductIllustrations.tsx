      design team migrate svg assets from Illustrator to Figma. The hope was
      that we could leverage Figma variants/components to create product
      illustrations faster within Figma as opposed to Illustrator. The main
      gripe was that Illustrator took too long to open and most of our workflow
      within the Design team was shifting towards Figma. The experiment was also
      to see if exported product illustrations (as SVG) from Figma would work
      well with After Effects with Bodymovin (for Lottie).`;

          to copy and paste components within different files in order to create
          an illustration. Furthermore, type styles were free form and thus had

          well as some typographic elements. I tried to export all assets as
          SVGs and thus importing them within Figma, but eventually had to
          redraw a good 40% of the assets. This took about a week tops and that
          took the majority of the project. The rest of my time was spent
          cleaning up and organizing the components to pilot and help me learn
          how to leverage Figma Variants, as the feature was recently released.`}

          that the brand team makes - consumer or enterprise. I noticed that
          existing product illustrations had varying type styles, some body text
          for the same elements would vary from 11px to 17px. Even elements like
          buttons sometimes had varying font sizes and some were sentence case
          while others were upper case. Thus, creating some guidelines around
          type usage would also help designers create illustrations faster.`}
