    At Blend, I was fortunate enough to create a whole process around
    prototyping and make it a reality for Engineering, Product, and Design. You
    can read more about my journey {prototypingAtBlendLink}. One project that I
    hold dear to my heart is {oneTapLink}, as Iâ€™ve been able to leverage the
    prototype for user studies, sales demos, and exploratory concepts to help
    product designers design faster. My high fidelity prototypes (especially in
    React) have seen to be useful for both design and engineering, as they serve
    as an addition to mocks.
