    At Blend, I was fortunate enough to create a whole process around
    prototyping and make it a reality for Engineering, Product, and Design. A
    notable project would be {oneTapLink}, as Iâ€™ve been able to leverage the
    prototype for user studies, sales demos, and exploratory concepts to help
    product designers design faster. At Carta, I built roughly 1-2 prototypes
    each quarter for user testing as well as proof of concept testing, where I
    collaborated with designers to elevate their designs through providing
    feedback around ui/components, edge cases, and more.
