    Design systems is currently my passion. In one way or another, I got my
    first taste of design systems while I was at Intuit, where I owned and
    contributed to an accordion component. Then, I moved to Blend, where I was a
    founding member of {AlchemyLink}, a themeable design system to support
    Blendâ€™s various products. Before working on Alchemy, I helped create and
    maintain Figma libraries, write documentation, address design debt, and host
    UI reviews for our fellow product designers. Afterwards, I joined Carta to
    continue my work around {Ink} where I lead the "Ink on Figma" effort,
    contributed to Ink's codebase, and prototyped designs for the "Employee"
    (aka "Shareholder") pillar. I have also worked as a contractor for {Vesta},
    where I built out the whole design system from the ground up.
