                    <b>Overview</b>
                    <p>This was a team project with fellow friend and classmate Lisa Jung | <a href = "http://lisayungijung.me/">website</a> to create a mobile app prototype that informs users of energy consumption for each building at CMU and to raise awareness of environmentally friendly energy consumption.
                    </p>

                    <b>The Issue</b>
                    <p>With Ecotecture, we wanted to try and raise awareness about energy consumption on campus, as CMU does actively try to make each building "green" or energy efficient, but students typically do not know, or simply even care. With our mock app, we tried to educate individuals about the green technologies and also energy usage from buildings like dorms to lecture halls.
                    </p>

                    <b>Process</b>
                    <p>Since this project was just to make a mock app, we split up the roles. I mainly focused on the features of the app and drafted the proposal, while Lisa made the preliminary sketches/mockups. You can read about the proposal and the documentation <a href = "css/ecotecture_proposal.pdf">here</a></p>
