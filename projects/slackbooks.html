                    <b>Overview</b>
                    <p>This was a hackathon project done for the NGN Hackathon during my internship at Intuit for the Summer of 2016. My team won the hackathon withour product called Slackbooks: a chat bot to help people collaborate on a business's accounting.

                    <b>Process</b>
                    <p>We found that chat bots were growing lately and we realized that collaboration is always something that could be made easier at the workplace or within teams (with the use of slack and other chat applications). Thus we thought of making a chatbot to directly interact with Intuit's Quickbooks API.
