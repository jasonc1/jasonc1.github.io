                    <b>Overview</b>
                    <p>My Project at Intuit was to make a front end for an internal tool called the Data Parity tool, which was for the IDEA team (Intuit Data Engineering and Analytics). Notable technologies used were AngularJS, html/css and javascript. My project consisted of 3 steps: learning the backend, designing the front end, and implementing the front end.
                    </p>

                    <b>The Issue</b>
                    <p>The Data Parity tool was made a couple years ago as a toll to make sure that data is correct in database A and database B. The tool took in a file path to a JSON file (which had the information to connect to the databases).However, the usability for the tool was very low because users were not sure what specific information the JSON file had to include, and furthermore it was run via command line. Thus, my project was to help increase usability by creating a front end for the system in order to help users provide proper JSON files.
                    </p>

                    <b>Process</b>
                    <p>Due to my NDA, I am not allowed to show screenshots of the system or the live system itself. I however, can show some of my preliminary sketches. One thing to comment is that there were very few design guidelines I had to follow, so creating the frontend was rather free form - all fonts, colours, and design decisions were arbitrary.
                    </p>
                    <div class = "sketch">
                        <img src = "../img/Portfolio/Scan.jpg"/>
                         </div>
                    <div class = "sketch">

                    <img src = "../img/Portfolio/Scan1.jpg"/>
                         </div>

                    <p>Here you can see two iterations of the home page for the Data Parity tool. I ended up going for the right hand sketch, as it was a little simpler of a design.
                    </p>


                    <div class = "sketch">
                    <img src = "../img/Portfolio/Scan2.jpg"/>
                         </div>

                    <div class = "sketch">
                    <img src = "../img/Portfolio/Scan3.jpg"/>
                         </div>

                    <p>As for the create config section, I drew out each individual section on separate sheet of paper - that way I could draw it bigger and focus a little more on the details as opposed to drawing with a restrained space.
                    </p>
                    <div class = "sketch">
                    <img src = "../img/Portfolio/Scan4.jpg"/>
                                </div>

                    <p>Overall, these sketches were rather quick - they took me about 2 hours to conjure. I spent most of my time designing this on Illustrator so I could get a better idea of the finer details.

                    <b>Overview</b>
                    <p>For my second internship at Intuit, I was assigned a project to do test integration and automation for one of Intuit's data pipelines. I mainly created modules to generate input data, and thus creating expected outputs so that the test suite could then compare to the pipeline's outputs. 
                    <br><br>
                    We used an in-house test framework to make the testing suite, and my components were put into the framework to generate, send, and compare data.
