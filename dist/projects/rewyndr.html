                    <b>Overview</b>
                    <p>My role (part time) at Reywndr varied from bit to bit. The most of my deliverables were on the web front. I started out working as an Android developer, but the environment could not be set up, thus I moved towards doing web design prototypes towards my last few months.

                    <b>Process</b>

                    <p>Through designing this website, I mainly focused on the companies main products and came up with all the technical writing as well. I also worked on a design for one of the products.
