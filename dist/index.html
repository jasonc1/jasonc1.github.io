                Hi, I'm Jason, and this is my portfolio. I'm more or less some sort of developer that is passionate about building things
                fast and turning design mocks into prototypes.
              </p>
              <p>
                I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017 with a B.S. in Information Systems and a B.S. in Human Computer Interaction.
                I am currently a Software Engineer at Intuit stationed in Mountain View, CA. I work on the the UI for getting
                Quickbooks customers signed up for Payments. You can find my resume

              </p>
              <p>
                Some of my hobbies include analog photography, music, design, and working out. You can checkout my instagram

              I currently work at Intuit as a Software Engineer primarily focused on React with Redux + Redux Saga. My team focuses on Payments Onboarding, where we maintain the sign up flows for QuickBooks customers to get set up with Payments. I spent my time at Intuit driving my own projects not only on the user experience but also the technical implementation.

            <p class="project-description">
              StratRoulette [SR] is a project created by my good friend Justin Chen from CMU. SR essentially rolls the dice for you and randomly decides, based on community sourced plays or strats, how you should play each round of CounterStrike. What was first a weekend project eventually grew and gained a huge amount of traction, and now we are working on re-skinning the whole website as well as adding new features. I work primarily as his designer, and I oversee the front end development of the site. We are currently working towards making StratRoulette live soon and we are aiming to gather more community engagement towards gaming and having fun.

            <p class="project-description">
              Chartly was a several week exercise where I took the option of making a unique tool for UX designers to help users simply generate charts (bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and maybe a few more common ones) so that they would not have to come up with fake data but more importantly not have to design a graphic to display data. Essentially, the user would choose what type of chart he/she would want, put in labels for the chart and axis ranges, and the application would do the rest. Specifically, the user would go through a step by step process of configuring their chart and the application would generate it using Chart.js

            <p class="project-description">
              Viewfinder is small exercise that was created based on my own experiences as a photographer: people kept asking me for camera recommendations, and I loved giving feedback and advice to others, but I found myself asking the same set of questions: what's your budget? what type of photography are you interested in? etc. I wanted to delve into what was first a cool looking icon that I made but then became a tool where I could help my friends and others get into photography. I wanted to make something that could be interactive and somewhat specific enough that could be tailored towards helping someone find a camera that suits their needs without breaking their wallet.

            <p class="project-description">
              Manna was a semester long project that I had the pleasure of working with Prof H as an independent study during my last semester of college in effort to help alleviate the painful paper based process that his church went through to provide aid for fellow members. We simplified the process of countless email threads and attachments to a system where Deacons of the church could open cases to provide aid for someone and attach relevant documents so that other Deacons could vote and discuss. I designed the mobile-first UI and implemented a system in Ruby on Rails in a matter of months to deliver to Prof H's church.
