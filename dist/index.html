                Hi, I'm Jason, and this is my portfolio. I'm passionate about building things
                fast and turning design mocks into prototypes.
              </p>
              <p>
                I graduated from <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> in 2017 with a B.S. in <strong>Information Systems</strong> and a B.S. in <strong>Human Computer Interaction</strong>.
                I am currently a Software Engineer at Intuit stationed in Mountain View, CA. I work on the the UI for getting
                Quickbooks customers signed up for Payments. You can find my resume
                <a href="misc/jason_chen_resume_2017.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> or scroll down.
              </p>

                Some of my hobbies include analog photography, music, design, and working out. You can checkout my instagram
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/me.dium/" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to shoot me an email at
                <u>jasonc1@alumni.cmu.edu</u> to talk anything about code, UI/UX, photography (both digital and analog), or

                StratRoulette [SR] is a project created by my good friend Justin Chen from CMU. SR essentially rolls the dice for you and
                randomly decides, based on community sourced plays or strats, how you should play each round of CounterStrike.
                What was first a weekend project eventually grew and gained a huge amount of traction, and now we are working
                on re-skinning the whole website as well as adding new features. I work primarily as his designer, and I
                oversee the front end development of the site.

                <i>designs and high-fidelity prototypes<br><br></i>
                Chartly was a several week exercise where I took the option of making a unique tool for UX designers to help users simply
                generate charts (bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and maybe a few more common ones) so that they would
                not have to come up with fake data but more importantly not have to design a graphic to display data.

              Manna was a semester long project that I had the pleasure of working with Prof H as an independent study during my last semester
              of college in effort to help alleviate the painful paper based process that his church went through to provide
              aid for fellow members. I designed the mobile-first UI and implemented a system in Ruby on Rails in
              a matter of months to deliver to Prof H's church.

              <i>designs and high-fidelity prototypes<br><br></i>
              Viewfinder is small exercise that was created based on my own experiences as a photographer: people kept asking me for camera
              recommendations, and I loved giving feedback and advice to others, but I found myself asking the same set of
              questions: what's your budget? what type of photography are you interested in? etc.I wanted to make something that could be interactive and somewhat specific enough that
              could be tailored towards helping someone find a camera that suits their needs without breaking their wallet.

                <i>Designs and usability analysis<br><br></i>
                As a sneakerhead, I browse the internet for information on new shoes, and one of the main sites is Hypebeast.com. I find the website quite frustrating from a usability standpoint due to how forceful the org is with their content. Furthermore, their articles make it hard to find information as it is hidden within blocks of flowerly language. I take a stab at redesigning their footwear section so that it makes browsing content easier for a user to consume information.
